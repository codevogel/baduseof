# Bad Use Of

_A gallery of bad ideas._

We've all heard the saying:

> **"There's no such thing as a bad idea."**

Well... sorry to break it to you, but **some ideas _are_, in fact, bad.** Or -
more generously - _unhelpful, inefficient, and, occasionally - hilarious._

And the thing is: **we all do this.** Any human being makes questionable
decisions all the time. **Bad Use Of** collects those moments - not to shame
(okay, maybe a little), but mostly so we can:

- Notice our own bad ideas
- Laugh at them
- And _maybe_ stop doing it

## **Some Examples of Bad Ideas**

You've probably seen at least one of these. Probably today. Heck, there's a good
chance that you are reading this precisely _because_ you just had one of them.

### Asking 'Can I ask a question?'

You already did. Just ask the question.

### Starting a Conversation with 'hi', and then just waiting for a response

You're not opening a ceremony. Say what you need. Save everyone time.

### Scanning that random QR code you found on the street

It's just so tempting, isn't it? But who knows where it leads?

### Using AI as a Source of Truth

AI is great at sounding confident, not at being correct. Use it to **think
with**, not to **replace thinking.**
