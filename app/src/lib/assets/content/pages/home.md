# Bad Ideas Exist

We've all heard the saying:

> **"There is no such thing as a bad idea."**

Well, sorry to break it to you, but **bad ideas do exist**. They can lead to
wasted time, resources, and even harm.

> Q: Does that mean I should feel bad for having a bad idea?

No. In fact, recognizing and learning from bad ideas is a crucial part of
growth.

We all have bad ideas from time to time. And that's okay. Bad ideas only become
problematic when we refuse to acknowledge that they are, in fact, bad.

> Q: So, how do I know if my idea is bad?

Well, you don't. Until you do.

Sometimes, you might have to fall flat on your face to realize that an idea was
bad. Or, you might get some feedback from others that helps you see the flaws in
your thinking. The difficult part is being open to the idea that your idea...
sucks.

This site is dedicated to cataloging bad ideas. To poke some fun at them, but
mostly to learn from them, and warn others about making the same mistakes.

So, go ahead. Take a look at [the bad ideas listed here](/topics). Maybe you'll
be faced with an idea that you once thought was great, but now realize was
actually pretty terrible.

you can submit your own bad idea.
